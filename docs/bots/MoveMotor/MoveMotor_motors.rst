MOVEMotor motors
====================================================


Set up the buggy
----------------------------------------

.. py:class:: MOVEMotorMotors() 

| Set up the buggy motors for use.
| Use ``buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()`` to be able to use the motor methods on the buggy.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

----

Duration parameter
----------------------------------------

| The Buggy methods that drive the motors have a duration parameter. 
| The duration parameter specifies how long the motor runs for.
| The default duration is ``None``. If the duration is ``None`` or is not specified the motor will run continuously until another command is sent to it.
| e.g. using the duration parameter: ``buggy.forwards(10, duration=5000)``  the buggy stops after 5 sec.
| e.g. not using the duration parameter: ``buggy.forwards(10)`` the buggy runs forwards continuously.

----

Independent motor control
----------------------------------------

| The left and right motors can be controlled independently using the four methods below:
| ``left_motor(speed=1, duration=None)`` runs the left motor.
| ``right_motor(speed=1, duration=None)`` runs the right motor.
| ``stop_left()`` stops the left motor.
| ``stop_right()`` stops the right motor.

left_motor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: left_motor(speed=1, duration=None)

    | Make the left motor run. 
    | ``speed`` values are integers or floats (decimals) from -10 to 10.
    | Default ``speed`` is 1.
    | If speed < 0 the motor turns the wheel backwards.
    | ``duration`` values are integers above 0.
    | Default ``duration`` is None.
    | The motor will stop after a given duration in milliseconds.
    | If the duration is None, the motor runs without stopping.

| ``left_motor()`` and ``left_motor(1)`` and ``left_motor(speed=1)`` all set the speed to 1.
| ``left_motor(2, 1000)`` and ``left_motor(2, duration=1000)`` and ``left_motor(speed=2, duration=1000)`` all run the left motor at speed to 2 for 1 sec.

| The code below, using ``left_motor(5)``,  runs the left motor at about half speed.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.left_motor(5)

| The code below, using ``left_motor(2, 5000)``,  runs the left motor at speed 2 for 5 sec.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.left_motor(2, 5000)

----

right_motor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: right_motor(speed=1, duration=None)

    | Make the right motor run. 
    | ``speed`` values are integers or floats (decimals) from -10 to 10.
    | Default ``speed`` is 1.
    | If speed < 0 the motor turns the wheel backwards.
    | ``duration`` values are integers above 0.
    | Default ``duration`` is None.
    | The motor will stop after a given duration in milliseconds.
    | If the duration is None, the motor runs without stopping.

| ``right_motor()`` and ``right_motor(1)`` and ``right_motor(speed=1)`` all set the speed to 1.
| ``right_motor(2, 1000)`` and ``right_motor(2, duration=1000)`` and ``right_motor(speed=2, duration=1000)`` all run the right motor at speed 2 for 1sec.

| The code below, using ``right_motor(speed=4, duration=3000)``, runs the right motor at speed 4 for 3 sec.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.right_motor(speed=4, duration=3000)

| The code below, using ``right_motor(-10)``, runs the right motor backwards at full speed.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.right_motor(-10)


----

stop_left
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: stop_left()

    | Stop the left motor.


| The code below runs the left motor continuously, but after 1 sec, it stops it.
| The motor keeps running during the sleep.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.left_motor()
    sleep(1000)
    buggy.stop_left()


----

stop_right
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: stop_right()

    | Stop the right motor.


| The code below runs the right motor at speed 4, then after 2 sec, stops it.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.right_motor(4)
    sleep(2000)
    buggy.stop_right()

----

Stop both motors
----------------------------------------

.. py:method:: stop()

    | Stop both motors.


| The code below runs the left motor at speed 5 and the right motor at speed 2, then after 1500ms stops them both.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()
    
    buggy.left_motor(5)
    buggy.right_motor(2)
    sleep(1500)
    buggy.stop()


----

.. admonition:: Tasks

    #. Write code to drive the left motor at speed 2 for 1 second, stop it, run the right motor at speed 2 for 1 sec then stop it.
    #. Write code to drive the right motor at speed 3 while the left motor runs at speed 2 for 3 sec then stop it.
    #. Write code to drive the left motor at speed 3 while the right motor runs at speed 2 for 3 sec then stop it.
    #. Write code that drives the left side faster than the right side then the right side faster the left side so that it zig zags for 5 sec then stop it.
    #. Write code so that the buggy repetitively zig zags forwards for 5 zigs and zags then backwards for 5 zigs and zags.
    #. Modify the zig zag code so that it uses variables for the 2 motor speeds, the number of zig zags forwards and backward, and the time for each zig and zag.

----

Straight line control
----------------------------------------

| The left and right motors can be run so that the buggy moves forwards or backwards in a straight line:
| ``forwards(speed=1, duration=None, decrease_left=0, decrease_right=0)``
| ``backwards(speed=1, duration=None, decrease_left=0, decrease_right=0)``
| ``decrease_left`` is used to reduce the motor speed on the left side in case the buggy drifts to the right due to the left motor being slightly faster than the right.
| ``decrease_right`` is used to reduce the motor speed on the right side in case the buggy drifts to the left due to the right motor being slightly faster than the left.
| Any ``decrease_left`` and ``decrease_right`` values used to give a straight line are best found by experimentation.

forward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: forwards(speed=1, duration=None, decrease_left=0, decrease_right=0)

    | Drive the buggy forward.
    | ``speed`` values are integers or floats (decimals) from 0 to 10.
    | Default ``speed`` is 1.
    | ``duration`` values are integers above 0.
    | Default ``duration`` is None.
    | The motor will stop after a given duration in milliseconds.
    | If the duration is None, the motor runs without stopping.
    | ``decrease_left`` and ``decrease_right`` take numbers from 0 to 20. These are converted to a percentage of the maximum analog motor speed of 255 (speed setting 10) so they have similar effect at any speed.
    | ``decrease_left`` and ``decrease_right`` default values are 0.


| ``forwards(10, None, 6)`` and ``forwards(10, None, 6, 0)`` and ``forwards(speed=10, decrease_left=6)`` all set the speed to 10 with the left wheel slowed by roughly 2% (6/255).

| The code below, has an adjustment of 6 to the left motor. 
| This is roughly a 2% (6/255) decrease in speed.
| It drives the buggy forwards at speed 10 for 5 secs.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.forwards(speed=10, duration=5000, decrease_left=6, decrease_right=0)


----

backward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: backwards(speed=1, duration=None, decrease_left=0, decrease_right=0)

    | Drive the buggy backwards.
    | ``speed`` values are integers or floats (decimals) from 0 to 10.
    | Default ``speed`` is 1.
    | ``duration`` values are integers above 0.
    | Default ``duration`` is None.
    | The motor will stop after a given duration in milliseconds.
    | If the duration is None, the motor runs without stopping.
    | ``decrease_left`` and ``decrease_right`` take numbers from 0 to 20. These are converted to a percentage of the maximum analog motor speed of 255 (speed setting 10) so they have similar effect at any speed.
    | ``decrease_left`` and ``decrease_right`` default values are 0.


| ``backwards(10, None, 0, 3)`` and ``backwards(speed=10, decrease_right=3)`` both set the speed to 10 with the right wheel slowed by roughly 1% (3/255).

| The code below, has an adjustment of 3 to the right motor. 
| This is roughly a 1% (3/255) decrease in speed.
| The parameter names have been omitted in ``forwards(8, 4000, 0, 3)``; instead values are in their specified order.
| It drives the buggy backwards at speed 8 for 4 secs.

.. code-block:: python

    from microbit import *
    import MOVEMotor


    # setup buggy
    buggy = MOVEMotor.MOVEMotorMotors()

    buggy.backwards(8, 4000, 0, 3)
