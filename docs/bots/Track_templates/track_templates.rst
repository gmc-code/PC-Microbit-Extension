Track templates
====================================================

| The buggy can be programmed to follow a thin black line or a wide black track.
| Track templates are provided for printing. They can be cut up to create tacks of your own design.
| Several pages can be printed multiple times. The page numbers can be listed multiple times in the print dialog. e.g. 2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3 will print 6 copies of page 2 and 4 copies of page 3.

Track templates
----------------------------------------

| The track templates have various track segments that can be cut out to make a line following track.

Thin line track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| For a track with a thin line, download the word file :download:`linefollowtiles_thin.docx <files/linefollowtiles_thin.docx>`.
| The buggy can be placed with the **thin** line up the middle of it so that the line sensors are over **white** paper either side of the black line. When a line sensor comes over the black line, that side needs to turn away from the line before it crosses it.

Thick track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| For a track with a thick line, download the word file :download:`linefollowtiles_thick.docx <files/linefollowtiles_thick.docx>`.
| For a wide thick line, download the word file :download:`linefollowtiles_wide.docx <files/linefollowtiles_wide.docx>`.
| The buggy can be placed over the **thick** track or **wide** track so that the line sensors are over **black** paper. When a line sensor comes over the white surrounding paper, that side needs to turn away from the track edge back into the black area.
